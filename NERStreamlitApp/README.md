# 🧠 Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) App using spaCy & Streamlit

## 🚀 Project Overview

This app allows users to explore Named Entity Recognition (NER) using their own **custom labels and patterns** through spaCy's powerful `EntityRuler` component. Built with Streamlit, the interface makes it simple to experiment with pattern-based NER in real-time.

Named Entity Recognition is the task of identifying entities like names, organizations, dates, etc., in text. With this app, you can take control by defining exactly which entities to detect — useful for industry-specific terms or domain-specific NLP tasks.
