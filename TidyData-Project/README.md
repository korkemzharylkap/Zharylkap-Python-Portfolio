# Tidy Data Project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the principles of **tidy data** and its application in cleaning, organizing, and analyzing real-world datasets. Tidy data is a fundamental concept in data science, where each variable is stored in its own column, each observation is stored in its own row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.

In this project, I focused on transforming raw data into a tidy format for analysis and visualization. This involves various steps such as reshaping, cleaning, and manipulating data to ensure it adheres to tidy data principles.
