# 💼 Zharylkap-Python-Portfolio
My semester portfolio showcases a variety of projects and initiatives that reflect both my academic and personal growth. It includes:

1. 📊 **Data Analysis Projects**: These projects involve analyzing various datasets, including the Penguin Dataset, where I applied Python libraries like **pandas** for data manipulation, **matplotlib** for visualization, and **Streamlit** for creating interactive dashboards. These tools allowed me to clean, filter, and visualize data based on user-defined parameters.

2. 🦾 **Predictive Modeling**: I worked on building models to predict rating reviews, applying machine learning algorithms to analyze and make predictions based on user data. This project helped me hone my skills in data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and performance improvement.

3. 👩🏻‍💻 **Python Programming Exercises**: I completed a series of exercises focused on **Python** programming, including using libraries like **itertools** for combinatorics, data manipulation, and functional programming techniques to solve complex problems efficiently.

4. 💡 **SQL and Database Skills**: I also currently focused on developing my SQL skills, working on exercises to query and manipulate datasets, which provided me with a deeper understanding of relational databases and data management.

This portfolio showcases my ability to handle real-world data, clean and preprocess it, build predictive models, and create interactive applications to communicate data insights effectively. It reflects my ongoing learning and application of coding and data analysis skills in meaningful ways.
